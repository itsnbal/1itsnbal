      <description>I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree.&#xA;A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earth&amp;rsquo;s sweet flowing breast;&#xA;A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to pray;&#xA;A tree that may in Summer wear A nest of robins in her hair;</description>

      <description>If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don&amp;rsquo;t deal in lies, Or being hated, don&amp;rsquo;t give way to hating, And yet don&amp;rsquo;t look too good, nor talk too wise:</description>
